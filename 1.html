        <h2>Current Status</h2>
        <p>Currently, while maintaining a grasp of my professional course knowledge, I also spend some of my time on my personal interests. I have some accomplishments in music, particularly in playing the guitar and drums, and I plan to self-study some music theory next, to gain the ability to compose and arrange my own music.</p>
        <p>In addition, I often spend time on outdoor activities, such as cycling. After entering university, I bought a road bike and frequently explore this unfamiliar city after a day's classes. Next, I might buy a motorcycle to experience even more of the natural scenery.

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>I plan to set up an independent game studio with friends after graduation. This way of living aligns with my interests and professional skills, and it won't be too stressful, so I consider it my future goal. At the same time, I will integrate my pursuit of music into it.

        <h2>Specialties</h2>
        <p>My professional strengths lie in meticulous project planning and comprehensive team management. I can clearly outline a complete project plan, providing direction for the team's work. At the same time, I consider the characteristics of each team member and allocate tasks reasonably. Also, I am highly receptive to new knowledge and have a good ability for self-learning. In terms of English, my current IELTS score is 5.5, and I plan to reach 6 this year.</p>
